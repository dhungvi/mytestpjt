coverage depth >= 20, now use 20.

ovlThreshold=40

checkAS1:
window=150
Two standards work:
1) 
threshold=size/2
previous window: noOfNonovl > threshold
second window: noOfNonovl > threshold
Use second window as startPos and endPos.

2)
threshold=size*size*3/16
current window: noOfNonovl > threshold
Use current window as startPos and endPos.

The identified window is almost always the one just before the window where the separation point is located.
All the strings with starting position<=startPos are used to construct first part. 
All the strings with starting position>startPos are used to construct last parts. 
Here we don't use endPos.
